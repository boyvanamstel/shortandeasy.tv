My first video's audio was brought to you by my trusty iPhone headphones. Together with me coughing and sniffling throughout the video the experience wasn't stellar.

To remedy this I took some vitamin C and invested in a broadcasting stand, shockmount, popfilter and sweet studio microphone; the [Samson C01U Pro USB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HXE4BYW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00HXE4BYW&linkCode=as2&tag=boysnot-21). The name of which is hilarious if you grew up in the Netherlands or Belgium. I will for always associate Samson with a fake dog and his owner Gert.

I did a test run, live streaming Zombi for the Playstation 4 and it sounds great. Check out the video below to hear for yourself.
