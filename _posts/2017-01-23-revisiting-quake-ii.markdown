When it appeared in magazines in the 90s it blew my mind. For months I read about how it was prettier, better and more awesome than anything that came before it. I bought a [3Dfx card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive#Voodoo_Graphics_PCI) for this game.

The moment I entered [the Outer Base](http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Base) for the first time is etched in my memory and I still remembered every inch of the map when I launched it last week. The game aged pretty well, in my opinion. [Too bad auto-save wasn't as popular as it is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eib4T3trvfU).

I also noticed that the resolution can't be set higher than 1600 by something and the controls don't feel as smooth as contemporary first-person-shooters. Luckily, there's a way to fix this: source ports.

A source port rewrites the game's engine to allow it to run on different platforms, fix bugs or allow modern machines to run it. After some research I came across [Yamagi Quake II](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/). It fixes the problems I described above and even adds some modern graphics options.

With all that in place I decided to do a play through of the first few maps. [Like and subscribe](/youtube) if you enjoy the video so you'll know when the next part hits YouTube.
