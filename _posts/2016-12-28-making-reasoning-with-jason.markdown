Over the few days that [Friday the 13th: The Game](http://f13game.com) was open to Kickstarter backers and other lucky individuals that got hold of a beta key, I [collected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Td_S8C9GA) [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZeYA08novs) a [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhKa1chjmI0) of [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EJrII4zNF4). Even in this early stage, the game was very entertaining, albeit frustrating at times because of the many bugs. I decided to compile one glitch-induced event into a short film.

## Capturing

Most of my source material is captured on my PC, while playing and streaming the game to YouTube, with [Open Broadcaster Software or OBS for short](https://obsproject.com). It's less straightforward than some of the alternatives, but it's very flexible and most of the setup has to be done only once.

The interface is crude and getting it up and running can be a bit of a hassle, especially since most video tutorials were created using an older version. The most important tweak I made was to add [AMD Media Framework](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/4vbgeq/amd_vce_media_framework_support_for_obs_studio/) support. This allows my GPU to take care of much of the rendering.

## Story

Before jumping into editing clips, I thought of a little story and angle for my video. During one of my playthroughs I ended up getting stuck when I was filling up one of the cars in the game with gas. Another counselor happened to be close by and after trying various methods to unstick me, Jason shows up. I tried talking him into grabbing or hitting me once and then letting me go. Of course that didn't go quite as planned. This short episode sounded like a great starting point for my video.

To flesh this out a little further I wrote down some of the scenes I wanted to cover, mainly to establish the environment, characters and mechanics of the game.

## Editing

Previously I used Apple's iMovie to edit promo videos for my [Danger Cove products](https://www.dangercove.com), but it always felt a little basic. In college I edited videos with AVID's editing suite, but that's on the other end of the spectrum; complex and hard to master. After some research I learned that BlackMagicDesign made their editing software [DaVinci Resolve 12.5](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) free to use, which made it a very easy choice to pick up and try.

DaVinci Resolve's UI is setup in such a way that it guides you through four distinct steps in producing your video: media management, editing, color grading and delivery.

With all relevant clips added to the media section, I proceeded to the editing phase of the program. There is no simple way to edit videos. It's a tedious task that requires you to go over minutes or hours of footage, cutting clips and placing them one after the other. I noted the keyboard shortcuts of some of the actions I would do often, like rippled cutting and pasting. Rippling makes sure all surrounding clips move back or forward when you add or remove a segment.

I'm by no means experienced editing videos, but one thing I've learned is that you want to stay clear of useless effects. There are many video transitions that you can use, but most will make your video look like a Powerpoint presentation from the 90's. I think I was pushing it with the Clock Wipe transition at the end of my video.

Every match in Friday the 13th: The Game you play either as a counselor, or Jason. I had to take clips from various games to get footage from the perspective of the unfortunate counselor and make it look like Jason was walking around in the same match. If you pay attention to the details you'll notice some things don't match up, but I'm confident most viewers won't suspect a thing.

## Sound 

I didn't spend too much time editing the audio. Only the Ki-ki-ki Ma-ma-ma in the beginning is added in and I decided to end on [Alice Cooper with He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)](https://play.spotify.com/track/5O6JuXxnhwG3W5YClY2mEb) from the Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives soundtrack. Other than that I just smoothed out the audio when transitioning from one scene to the next.

## Color grading 

There are [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojjfhCrjDus) a [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaKhcCgazP0) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojjfhCrjDus) that explain DaVinci Resolve's color grading options, but I think I need to watch a few more to actually improve the dark visuals I was working with.

## Delivery

All my footage was captured in 1080p at 60fps, obviously I setup my project to use the same characteristics. Exporting for YouTube is an absolute breeze in DaVinci Resolve. I just selected the YouTube 1080p preset, added the video to the render queue and 15 minutes later I could upload it straight to YouTube.

## End result

Enjoy! I spent way more time on this than I'm comfortable admitting.
